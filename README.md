# word-guess-game
This game lets you guess the letters to songs by popular Country Music Artists

In the Artist row you will see the name of a Country star. Below that is a song the star is known for. Enter characters to
guess the song until you guess correctly or run out of characters.

The number of guesses depends on the length of the song title (you won't get 20 tries to guess a four letter song)

Be sure to look at the controls to see your status, number of wins, unsucessful guesses and number of guesses remaining.
